/* Objective: To design a class batsman where it can be used for maintaining the information about the player. The details are
Name, innings played, not outs, runs. Using these details we are calculating the batting
average(runs/(innings -not out)), user are able to add the data by themselves for number of batmanâ€™s that they will mention during the runtime and along with that the data is displayed on console on demand
